I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Tulane University working in number theory expecting to graduate by December 2017. My advisor is Prof. Moll and co-advisor is [Prof. Atul Dixit](https://sites.google.com/a/iitgn.ac.in/atuldixit/) with whom I recently worked on finding a [beautiful generalization of Ramanujan-Guinand identity and in the process found and studied a new generalization of the modified Bessel function of the second kind $$K_z(x)$$](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05363). 


I am an aspiring data scientist and a machine learning enthusiast actively seeking internship opportunities for the Fall 2017. 

[Here](/images/Aashita_Resume.pdf) is my resume:
