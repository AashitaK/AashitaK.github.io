I am a recent math PhD graduate and a machine learning enthusiast. 

I have recently released a python package named [Bubbly](https://pypi.org/project/bubbly/) for plotting interactive and animated bubble charts using plotly. The animated bubble charts can accommodate six variables in total viz. X-axis, Y-axis, time, dots, their size and their color in a compact and captivating way. The function bubbleplot is easy to use with plenty of customization suitable for use with plotly [as demonstrated here](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/guide-to-animated-bubble-charts-using-plotly).

Below are some of the links detailing my recent project concerning comments posted on New York Times articles.
- A [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/nyt-comments), that was [among the 20 featured datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/nyt-comments) on Kaggle, comprised of over 1.2 million comments with 34 variables and over 9,000 articles with 16 variables along with the ideas for data science projects.
- A [Python package](https://github.com/AashitaK/nyt-comments) that includes three main functions to perform three distinct tasks involving the retrieval of comments' and articles' from New York Times as ready-to-use dataset for data science/machine learning projects:
  1. The main function **get_dataset** returns two dataframes - one each for the articles and the respective comments. The retrieval can be customized based on a number of parameters such as a specific timeline for the articles, search keywords, filter queries, etc.   
  2. The function **get_articles** is an API wrapper for NYT article search API, that returns the cleaned up and preprocessed data for articles as a ready-to-use pandas dataframe (or csv files) and the retrieval can be customized with the same options as above.
  3. The function **get_comments** retrieves the comments on NYT article(s) given their URLs. It can be used as a substitute for the comments by URL option in the NYT Community API that is now deprecated and has an [unresolved issue](https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/issues/29). This function does not use NYT API for the retrieval unlike the above two.
- The package is accompanied with an [illustrative tutorial](https://github.com/AashitaK/nyt-comments/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb) for its use containing detailed information regarding the functions and their parameters.
- [Exploratory data analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/exploratory-data-analysis-of-comments-on-nyt) of the features contained in the comments' and articles' dataset with statistical graphs. 
- [Bag of words models](https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/predicting-nyt-s-pick) to predict the probability that a certain comment will be selected as a NYT's pick. 
  1. Logistic Regression model coupled with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on Tf-Idf vectors of words and character n-grams of comments' text.
  2. NB-Logistic Regression model inspired from the paper [Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classiﬁcation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf) by Sida Wang and Chris Manning.
- [Word clouds](http://www.aashitak.com/data%20science/Wordclouds) for the visualization of the textual data for fun.
