I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Tulane University working in number theory expecting to graduate by December 2017. My advisor is Prof. Moll and co-advisor is [Prof. Atul Dixit](https://sites.google.com/a/iitgn.ac.in/atuldixit/) with whom I recently worked on finding a [beautiful generalization of Ramanujan-Guinand identity and in the process found and studied a new generalization of the modified Bessel function of the second kind $$K_z(x)$$](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05363). 


I am an aspiring data scientist and a machine learning enthusiast actively seeking internship opportunities.

My story: I first encountered the subject when I took an elective course in Artificial Neural Network in the fall of 2011 during my undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee. The subject material was challenging and I enjoyed every part of the course - theory, algorithms and coding. For the years ahead, I went back to singlemindedly working in my favorite subject number theory. It was a chance visit to Bangalore in the summer of 2016 and subsequent enrollment in Andrew Ng's course in [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) in Coursera that drew me back into the field. I am excitedly again a beginner in learning a field and I have never been more enthusiastic.
