I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Tulane University working in number theory. My advisor is Prof. Moll and co-advisor is [Prof. Atul Dixit](https://sites.google.com/a/iitgn.ac.in/atuldixit/) with whom I recently worked on finding a [beautiful generalization of Ramanujan-Guinand identity and in the process found and studied a new generalization of the modified Bessel function of the second kind K_z(x)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05363). 
$$K_z(x)$$

I am an aspiring data scientist. Here is a [link](https://github.com/AashitaK) to my github account that contains some of simple projects I completed in the process of learning tools for data science and machine learning.
$K_z(x)$
