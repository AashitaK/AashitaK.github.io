The divisibility by 2 of the sequence of integers follows a very regular pattern. Every second number is odd, 
that is, it is not divisible by 2. Out of the remainining integers, that are even numbers, every second is not divisible by 4. 
Then again among all the numbers divisible by 4, every second is not divisible by 8 and so on. The highest power of 2 that divides
an integer $n$ is called valuation of $n$ with respect to 2, denoted by $\nu_2(n)$. The divisiblity pattern described above can be 
summarized as a valuation tree, pasted here:
