The [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) lets you make your own website. 

* **_Free_** - Hosting is free, all you need is a github account.
* **_Fast_** - It supports Jekyll, a static site generator. Jekyll makes your site load fast - faster than any wordpress site and it handles traffic very well. FYI, [Obama campaign](https://contribute.ofa.us/donation/index-ovf-ec-alt-1.html) used Jekyll and so does Netflix.
* **_Simple_** - No coding required (not even html/css, Jekyll will do it for you), no server maintainence, no setting up domain, and no maintaining database. In case you are wondering, no need to learn git either; this blog shows you how. 
* **_Secure_** - No vulnerability to hacking unless your github password is hacked.

Advanced:

* It lets you include a comment section, like I used disqus for this blog, without the hassle of maintaining database and .
* If you already have a domain name or want to have one, its convenient to direct the published website to it.
