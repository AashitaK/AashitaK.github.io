A Poem by a Taoist Priest

Into a soul absolutely free  
From thoughts and emotion,  
Even the tiger finds no room  
To insert its fierce claws.


One and the same breeze passes  
Over the pines on the mountain  
And the oak tress in the valley;  
And why do they give different notes.


No thinking, no reflecting,  
Perfect emptiness;  
Yet therein something moves,  
Following its own course.


The eye sees it,  
But no hand can take hold of it â€“  
The moon in the stream  
Clouds and mists  
They are midair transformations;  
Above them eternally shine the sun and the moon.   


Victory is for the one,  
Even before combat,  
Who has no thought of himself,  
Abiding is the no-mind-ness of Great Origin.
