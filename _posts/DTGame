Decision Tree and game
Information game
Try to imagine designing the code game and deciphering it you will understand DT algo intuitively
Remember with words, its not just a random arrangement of symbols, but instead we are using valid four-letter words in english
There are inherent patterns in words that can not be so easily and accurately coded as a set of rules but DT will take care of it
with big enough training sample and using ensemble to avoid overfitting that DT is prone to.

Understanding this better also helps you to get peculiar examples that will be harder to guess

This will also help someone understand the importance of human intuition as well as its limitations as compared to machines
on account of speed and memory.
