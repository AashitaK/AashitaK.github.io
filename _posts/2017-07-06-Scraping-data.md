The first step for a data science project is to obtain the data to work with. 
In this age of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and the abundance of datasets freely available in read-to-use format to learn and practise 
data science tools, the very useful skill of scraping data from the internet is often neglected among the new initiates of data science.
Knowing how to gather data from the internet gives one more flexibity and independence to choose a project of one's own liking 
and this blog discusses data-scraping using python.
